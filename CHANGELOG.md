## [Unreleased]

### Phase 0 – scaffold
- Package skeleton: `composer.json` (PHP `^8.1`, `illuminate/*` `^10 | ^11 | ^12 | ^13`, `nikic/php-parser ^4.18 | ^5.0`), service provider, `Brand`, facade, `trace()` helper, full config file.
- Tooling: Testbench + Pest, PHPStan level 8 (Larastan), Pint, `.dev/` helper scripts for running every local PHP version.
- CI: Laravel 10/11/12/13 × PHP matrix with `prefer-lowest`/`prefer-stable`, DB jobs (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite), PHP 8.1 syntax guard, dist freshness job.
- `docs/decisions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

### Phase 1 – recorder, dumper, storage
- `Span`, `Recorder` (parent/child tree, span cap, collapsing of identical siblings into aggregate spans, ghost spans), `Clock` that excludes tracer overhead.
- Value dumper on Symfony `VarCloner` with casters for models, collections, exceptions, requests and responses; depth/items/string/span/trace limits; word-based key masking and value patterns.
- `TraceStorage` interface and `DatabaseStorage` (separate connection outside the app transaction, chunked inserts, gzip+base64 payloads, cursor pagination, filters, pruning); migration for the five tables.
- `Tracer`, `TraceSession`, global `RecordRequest` middleware (records in `handle`, persists in `terminate`), `RecordingDecider` (`always` / `triggered` / `off`, excluded paths), queued persistence job.
- First end-to-end recorded trace; masking proven against every stored table.
